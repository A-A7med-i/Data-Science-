# Google Play Store Apps Dataset

## Description
As a life-long fan of basketball, I always wanted to combine my enthusiasm for the sport with passion for analytics üèÄüìä. So, I utilized the NBA Stats API to pull together this data set. I hope it will prove to be as interesting to work with for you as it has been for me!
The data set contains over two decades of data on each player who has been part of an NBA teams' roster. It captures demographic variables such as age, height, weight and place of birth, biographical details like the team played for, draft year and round. In addition, it has basic box score statistics such as games played, average number of points, rebounds, assists, etc.

The pull initially contained 52 rows of missing data. The gaps have been manually filled using data from Basketball Reference. I am not aware of any other data quality issues.
