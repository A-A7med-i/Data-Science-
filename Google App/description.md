## Interpreting Box Plot
A box plot is a graphical representation of a dataset's distribution. It provides insights into the spread, skewness, and outliers within the data. The key components of a box plot are the quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), which divide the data into four equal parts. The median (Q2) represents the middle value, and the box extends from Q1 to Q3. Outliers are typically shown as individual points beyond the whiskers.
